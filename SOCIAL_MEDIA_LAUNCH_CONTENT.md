## 📖 EDUCATIONAL CONTENT

### Post: Plant Care Tips

```
💡 5 Mistakes Killing Your Indoor Plants:

1️⃣ Overwatering
Most plants die from too MUCH water, not too little. Stick your finger in soil - only water when top 2" is dry.

2️⃣ Wrong pot (no drainage)
Always use pots with drainage holes. Decorative pots = root rot!

3️⃣ Garden soil in pots
Garden soil compacts. Use proper potting mix with cocopeat & perlite.

4️⃣ Ignoring humidity
AC rooms dry out tropical plants. Group them together or use pebble trays.

5️⃣ Direct afternoon sun
Most houseplants prefer bright INDIRECT light. East windows > West windows.

### Post: Monsoon Care

```
🌧️ Monsoon Plant Care Checklist:

□ Reduce watering by 50%
□ Move plants away from direct rain
□ Improve air circulation (small fan)
□ Check for pests weekly
□ Pause fertilizing until rains ease
□ Watch for fungal infections

During monsoon, soil stays wet longer. The #1 cause of plant death this season = OVERWATERING!

When in doubt, don't water. Check soil first. 🌿
