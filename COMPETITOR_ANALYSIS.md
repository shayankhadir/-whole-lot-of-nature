## 🔐 Technical Architecture

### TAOS Architecture
- **Platform:** Shopify
- **Frontend:** Custom (Headless)
- **Backend:** Shopify API
- **Database:** Shopify-managed

### Your Architecture
- **Platform:** WordPress/WooCommerce
- **Frontend:** Next.js 14 (Headless)

**Key Difference:** Both are headless, but TAOS uses Shopify while you use WooCommerce. This is advantageous as WooCommerce is more customizable for your use case.
