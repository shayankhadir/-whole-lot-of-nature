2. **Marketing Automation Agent**
  - Ship geo-segmented flows (Bangalore-first) with concierge upsell, install bundle offers, kit builder promos.
  - Mirror competitor cadence: monthly workshop drip (Plant Craft), quarterly maintenance renewal (UrbanMali), seasonal discount windows (Ugaoo).

3. **Social/Design Agents**
  - Maintain lookbook + project carousel pipeline (inspired by Glastres/Sora) with weekly release schedule.
  - Auto-generate reel scripts around "Ask a Stylist" Q&A and unboxing/trust moments.

4. **Backlink Agent**
  - Target Bangalore lifestyle + agritech publications for Lalbagh heritage, IoT gardening, and terrace farming pieces.
  - Offer co-branded resources (whitepapers, design kits) to earn .in authority backlinks.

5. **Product & Checkout Enhancements**
  - Implement badges (Lalbagh Proven, Sensor-ready, Lab-tested), kit builder, and installation upsells directly in PDP + cart summary.
  - Surface maintenance subscription and concierge scheduling throughout the purchase journey.

**Key Takeaway:** Competitors win through trust signals (heritage, maintenance programs), bundled services (install + kit + subscription), and hyperlocal storytelling. Our roadmap wires those strengths into site UX and informs every automation agent’s prompts so messaging stays competitive in the Bangalore market.
