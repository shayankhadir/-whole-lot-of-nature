# 🌿 START HERE - Your Blog Publishing System

## You Have 3 Questions. Here Are Your Answers.

---

## ❓ Question 1: "When will my posts be published?"

### Answer: RIGHT NOW (as DRAFTS) 🟡

**What happens when agent runs:**
1. Collects trending topics ✅
2. Generates 5 blog posts ✅  
3. Sends to WordPress **as DRAFTS** ✅
4. **STOPS** - waiting for you
5. You manually click "Publish" in WordPress
6. Post goes LIVE 🚀

**Timeline:**
```
Agent runs → Posts created → Saved as DRAFT in WordPress
            ↓
        You review on WordPress
            ↓
        You click "Publish" button
            ↓
        Post goes LIVE on your website ✅
```

**To make posts publish automatically later:**
- Change `publishStrategy` from `'draft'` to `'scheduled'` (posts auto-publish at set time)
- Or change to `'immediate'` (posts go live instantly - not recommended yet)

See: `PUBLISHING_STRATEGY_CONFIG.md` for how to change
